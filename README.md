# Native Jenkins Installation for macOS

This repository contains scripts to install, configure, and manage Jenkins natively on macOS without Docker.

## Prerequisites

- macOS operating system
- Administrative privileges (for some installation steps)
- SSH key for GitLab access (default: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)

## Installation

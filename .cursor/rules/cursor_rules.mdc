priority: high
description: Standards for placing Cursor rule files in the correct directory
filters:
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "*.mdc$"
    description: "Match files with [.mdc] extension"
  # Match files that look like Cursor rules
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_create"

actions:
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"
        message: "Cursor rule files (.mdc) must be placed in the .cursor/rules directory"

    message: |
        1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
          ```
          .cursor/rules/
          ├── your-rule-name.mdc
          ├── another-rule.mdc
          └── ...
          ```
      
        3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

  - type: suggest
    when: on_rule_creation_or_edit
    what: how_to_name
    message: |
      1. Follow the naming convention:
       - Use kebab-case for filenames
       - Always use .mdc extension
       - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      2. WHEN Rule is for particular file type (example file_type=[.kt]) THEN:
        - Use [kt] as suffix in rule name. 
          - Example: `my-rule.kt.mdc`
        - Add glob pattern in rule file front-matter, example for Kotlin files:
          ```
          ---
          globs: *.kt
          ---
          ```

    what: format_to_use_for_content
    message: |
      1. Use Markdown for rule content
      2. Use headings for different sections
      3. Use code blocks for code snippets
      4. Use lists for listing items
      5. If needed, use YAML for more structured rule formatting within Markdown.
        5a. Surround YAML with triple backticks '```yaml' and '```'
        5b. Use YAML for structured data like metadata, filters, and actions
        5c. Example:
          ```yaml
            - type: reject
              conditions:
                - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"
                  message: "Cursor rule files (.mdc) must be placed in the .cursor/rules directory"
            - type: suggest
              when: on_rule_creation_or_edit

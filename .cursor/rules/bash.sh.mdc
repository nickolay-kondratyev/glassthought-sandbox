Below are **two** possible reformatted versions for the remaining headings. Each version uses a similar structure to the provided *Mandatory Variable Checks* snippet—with sections for **What**, **Example** (with a code snippet labeled as “Input” when applicable), and either **Why** or **Benefits/Best Practices** as needed.

---

## **Version 1: Standardized Formatting**

```md
### Mandatory Variable Checks

#### What 
Ensure required parameters are provided using parameter expansion with error messages.

#### Example
##### Input 
```bash
local file_path="${1:?file name or path}"
```

#### Usage
```bash
echo "file=[${file_path:?}]"
```

#### Why
Guarantees that the script stops with a clear error if a required variable is missing.

---

### Proper Quoting

#### What
Always quote variable expansions to avoid unexpected word splitting and globbing.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
echo "file=[${file_path:?}]"
```

#### Why
- Preserves spaces and special characters.
- Produces predictable and reliable output.

---

### Local Scope for Variables

#### What
Within functions, use `local` to restrict variable scope.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
process.file() {
  local file_path="${1:?file name or path}"
  # Process the file
}
```

#### Why
Limits side effects by preventing variables from affecting the global environment.

---

### DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

#### What
Avoid duplicating code by encapsulating common logic into functions.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
function log_message() {
  local message="${1:?message text}"
  echo "Log: ${message}"
}

log_message "Starting process"
```

#### Benefits
- Simplifies maintenance.
- Reduces the risk of errors in repetitive code.

---

### Self-Documenting Code

#### What
Adopt clear, descriptive naming conventions and add succinct comments that explain **why** certain decisions were made.

#### Best Practices
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
- Comment on the intent and rationale, not just the actions.

---

### Consistent Error Handling

#### What
Implement a dedicated error-handling mechanism, such as a `throw` function, to manage failures uniformly.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
function throw() {
  local error_message="${1:?error message}"
  echo "Error: ${error_message}" >&2
  exit 1
}

# Usage example:
[ -f "$file_path" ] || throw "File does not exist: ${file_path}"
```
```

---

## **Version 2: Slight Variation with “Usage” When Applicable**

```md
### Mandatory Variable Checks

#### What 
Ensure required parameters are provided using parameter expansion with error messages.

#### Example
##### Input 
```bash
local file_path="${1:?file name or path}"
```

#### Usage
```bash
echo "file=[${file_path:?}]"
```

#### Why
Guarantees that the script stops with a clear error if a required variable is missing.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
process.file() {
  local file_path="${1:?file name or path}"
  # Process the file
}
```

#### Why
Prevents variables from leaking into the global environment.

---

### DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

#### What
Encapsulate common logic into functions to avoid code duplication.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
function log_message() {
  local message="${1:?message text}"
  echo "Log: ${message}"
}

log_message "Starting process"
```

#### Why
- Simplifies maintenance.
- Reduces the risk of errors from repetitive code.

---

### Self-Documenting Code

#### What
Write code that explains itself by using descriptive names and succinct comments that state the rationale.

#### Best Practices
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
- Comment on the intent and reasoning behind decisions.

---

### Consistent Error Handling

#### What
Adopt a uniform error-handling mechanism (e.g., a `throw` function) to manage failures.

#### Example
##### Input
```bash
function throw() {
  local error_message="${1:?error message}"
  echo "Error: ${error_message}" >&2
  exit 1
}

# Usage example:
[ -f "$file_path" ] || throw "File does not exist: ${file_path}"
```
```

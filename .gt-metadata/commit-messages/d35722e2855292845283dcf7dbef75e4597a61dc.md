     * 1. It reads the current value of [remaining].
     * 2. It applies the `if (current > 0) current - 1 else current` update function.
     * 3. It attempts to set the [remaining] value to this new result via CAS.
     *    - If another thread/coroutine updated [remaining] in between steps (1) and (3),
     *      the CAS fails, and `updateAndGet` automatically retries with the fresh value.
     *
     * By retrying until a single successful CAS occurs, collisions among multiple
     * parallel threads or coroutines are safely resolved. Each call will correctly
     * decrement the counter exactly once if itâ€™s above zero, and do nothing if itâ€™s
     * already zeroâ€”preventing the counter from ever going negative or missing
     * decrements due to concurrency.

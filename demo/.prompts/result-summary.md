You have successfully implemented the plan to expose Kotlin to JavaScript! Here's a summary of what we've done:
Modified build.gradle.kts to add JavaScript target and configurations
Created the JavaScript-specific implementation for Platform in Platform.js.kt
Added @JsExport annotation to the Greeting class to make it accessible from JavaScript
Created a public directory with an HTML file to test the integration
Added the necessary experimental flag to gradle.properties
Built the JavaScript bundle using Gradle
Copied the generated JavaScript file to the public directory
Created a simple server script to serve the HTML file
To run and test the implementation:
Run ./composeApp/serve.sh from the demo directory to start the server
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
You should see "Hello, JavaScript (Browser)!" in the output
You've successfully exposed Kotlin code from your Compose Multiplatform app to JavaScript, making the Greeting class accessible from JavaScript code.

‚è∫ Great! We have successfully completed all the steps to expose Kotlin code to JavaScript.

Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Modified composeApp/build.gradle.kts to add JavaScript as a target and set up the build configuration.
2. Created a JavaScript-specific implementation of the Platform interface in Platform.js.kt to provide platform-specific information for JavaScript.
3. Updated Greeting.kt to add @JsExport annotations for JavaScript interoperability.
4. Set up a public directory with an HTML file to test the JavaScript export.
5. Built the JavaScript bundle and copied it to the public directory.
